        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <h3>Central London Community Healthcare NHS, London UK</h3>
        <p><strong>Data Analyst</strong> - July 2021 - Present</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed 7 interactive Power BI dashboards with predictive analytics to monitor clinical and administrative KPIs – generating 500 daily views across 52 services. The dashboard automatically flags when a service is underperforming, identifies potential causes, and recommends solutions.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with clinicians, service managers, and board members in service review and strategic planning. Identified areas of concern through BAU reports and diagnostic packs by benchmarking and conducting statistical tests.</li>
            <li>Collated, cleaned, and standardized multiple data sources from clinical systems with live data and over 20 million data entries. Created Python and SQL scripts to improve the data loading time to BI products. Ensured quality checks with IG and QI teams following data guidelines.</li>
            <li>Line managed 3 NHS academy graduates in health informatics by providing training resources, sequencing their workload, and adopting agile working methodologies.</li>
            <li>Spearheaded the development of an end-to-end machine learning model (XGBoost) to predict the probability of patient attendance and waiting times, achieving up to 80% accuracy. Currently experimenting with Microsoft Azure to deploy the model to production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bristol Royal Infirmary NHS, Bristol UK</h3>
        <p><strong>Student Researcher (Data Science)</strong> - Oct 2018 – Jan 2019</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborated with doctors and data scientists on unsupervised learning research to identify patient subtypes in the ICU.</li>
            <li>Conducted exploratory data analysis on high-dimensional time series data across 37 biometric health features extracted from electronic health records.</li>
            <li>Implemented K-means clustering and identified 3 unique patient clusters in the ICU, with one cluster having a significantly higher mortality rate confirmed through statistical analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AI for Healthcare and Medicine, London UK</h3>
        <p><strong>Data Scientist</strong> - Jan 2022 – Present</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Replicated a published study on state-of-the-art deep learning for medical imaging. Trained an image segmentation model using the U-Net architecture to predict and locate brain tumors in 3D MRI images, achieving a sensitivity and specificity range of 79%-95%.</li>
            <li>Completing the DeepLearning.ai Coursera course in medical prognosis and treatments, covering topics such as building tree-based models for predicting survival rates, analyzing random control trials data, and extracting insights from clinical reports using BERT.</li>
        </ul>
